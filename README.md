# Scraping Project

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to use Selenium to scrape book information from a didactic website built for such purposes. The script navigates through a specified category on the website and extracts details about each book, including the title, price, availability, and rating. The data is then saved into a CSV file for further use. This was done as a learning project.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the Repository
2. Install Dependencies (ensure you have Python installed on your machine. Then, install the required Python packages on the requirements.txt)
3. Eun the Script

## Customization

You can change the category of books by modifying the `find_element(By.LINK_TEXT, 'Self Help')` line in the script to another category available on the website.
